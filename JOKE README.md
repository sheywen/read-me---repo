# Life is good when you live fairly

but it could get sucks when care is not taken
i rest my case here because many get it wrong when you're actually right
but that doesn't change the fact we're not perfect
nobody is perfect

but don't be decieved when they tell you it's easy, actually not is ever easy 

let roll and get rolled as we pen down our grieviances

cry, its allowed but don't share tears because some mosnters do't like to see tears. they might hurt you
